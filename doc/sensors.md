# Sensors used

## Door Open/closed

A vibration sensor could possibly detect when the door moves, if it shakes the frame sufficiently: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1766

A magnetic contact switch would actually detect door state: https://www.adafruit.com/product/375

## Temperature + Humidity

Waterproof digital temp sensor: https://www.adafruit.com/product/381
This could be used for measuring ground temperature for a Pi running in the shed (https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-your-own-weather-station/2).
